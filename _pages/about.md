title: "About Me"
---

I am currently finishing my PhD degree at the University of Adelaide. I use deep learning to solve various computer vision tasks in real-time and with high performance. Most often those are dense per-pixel tasks, where the goal is to predict some quantity of interest for each pixel in the image -- e.g. to classify whether the given pixel belongs to a cat or a dog. My aim is to simplify existing pipelines and algorithms in order to increase the range of possible applications of deep learning and to build more robust solutions.

When working, I often listen to all sorts of music that makes me focused -- primarily classical music, jazz, indie rock and hip-hop.

In my free time, I love watching football (read *Liverpool*) for pleasure and motivation. I also enjoy reading books in search for inspiration and to keep myself grounded.

I believe in hard work and curious mind.
