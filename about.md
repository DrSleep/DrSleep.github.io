I am currently a PhD researcher at the University of Adelaide with the focus on using deep learning for computer vision tasks, especially, dense per-pixel ones, such as semantic segmentation, in particular.

I like listening to all sorts of music when I am coding - including classical music (most recently, Janáček), indie rock, hip-hop  
I love watching football (read **Liverpool**) whenever I can - for pleasure and motivation  
I enjoy reading books to keep myself grounded and keep looking for inspiration
