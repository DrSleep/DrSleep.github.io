    <h1>Hi there ;)</h1>
    <p>My name is Vladimir, I am an enthusiastic self-learner (read <em>"nerd"</em>), who literally cannot spend a day without learning/reading about/discovering something new.</p>
    <p>I am passionate about many computer science and math-related things, including machine learning (and most recently deep learning, in particular), data science, and more human-like stuff, such as books, movies, sport.</p>
    <p> This blog will be echoing what I have been learning lately, and hopefully, will be providing new knowldege for someone else out there. The material will not cover topics at hand in depth, and rather will just touch the surface; nevertheless, where possible, I will be providing additional links to other sources.</p>
    <p>Keep open mind while you are reading <em>Xplorium</em> :) </p>
    <p>Enjoy, and have fun!</p>
